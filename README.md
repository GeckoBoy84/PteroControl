# PteroControl

This opensource code is currently not recommended for production use as it is not in a stable state. The public bot is inviteable [here](https://discord.gg/AMCTzrmRPY) and will receive updates and bug fixes prior to this source code to ensure stability. As such there is limited support provided with this version of the bot, however this will be improved in the next releases of the bot.
